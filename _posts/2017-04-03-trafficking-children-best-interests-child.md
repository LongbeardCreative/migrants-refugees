Speech of Father Michael Czerny, S.J., Under-Secretary of the Migrants and Refugees Section, at a conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna, Austria, on 03 April 2017.

<em>"At Bethlehem, Pope Francis expressed this vision: “Today too, children are a sign. They are a sign of hope, a sign of life, but also a ‘diagnostic’ sign, a marker indicating the health of families, society and the entire world. Wherever children are accepted, loved, cared for and protected, the family is healthy, society is more healthy and the world is more human.”15 Let this be our firm purpose during this 17th Conference and in the courageous actions to which it subsequently leads."
