Fr Michael Czerny meets with interns from <a href="https://stmikes.utoronto.ca/">St. Michael's College, Toronto</a>, who are in Rome learning about entrepreneurship and social innovation.

&nbsp;

During their meeting, Fr Michael spoke of the importance of forming responsible leaders and taking the time for spiritual reflection and meditation. The interns asked tough questions about how to realize opportunities and embrace innovation within large organizations. In this our complex and technologically rapidly advancing age, they considered the commitment made by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MandRSection/">Migrants &amp; Refugees Section</a>, since it began in Jan 2017, to social media and platform sharing as relevant forms outreach, communication, evangelization.
