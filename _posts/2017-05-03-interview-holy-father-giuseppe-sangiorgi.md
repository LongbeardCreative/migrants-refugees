<em>"It was a great pleasure to interview the Holy Father for libertàcivili,and it was a great honour to hear his answers about immigration,one of the most important topics of our time, so rich with human,social and political consequences. Pope Francis is the moral and civil reference point with a world vision based on solidarity. In the following interview, the Holy Father speaks on four different subjects:religious dialogue as a background for peaceful relations between people, the commitment of the Catholic Church to the problems of migrants and refugees, the drive toward international cooperation as a task of the European Union, ad the role of communication for a real understanding of migration.”</em>
