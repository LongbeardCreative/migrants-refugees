Speech of Father Michael Czerny, S.J., Under-Secretary of the Migrants and Refugees Section, from the Meeting of Popular Movements in Modesto, California, on 17 February 2017.

<em>"Thank you for the welcome that I have received. This Regional Meeting of Popular Movements is a chance to listen. Listening is always a good place to start, so that our response gets built, not on what we imagine or think is best, but on what people really live and really need."</em>
